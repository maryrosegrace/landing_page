If you are interested in donating your time on the camping or survival trips by acting as a chaperone and/or providing shore skiff transportation, please fill out the chaperone here. Have your student turn the form into their science teacher. You will also need to submit a background check; to do this simply come to the Schoenbar Middle School office with your photo I.D.</p1></p></div>
