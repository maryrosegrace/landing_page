SMS Survial Trip 

This website was created as part of the ODIN Project. 
This is the landing page project which I changed up a bit to make a homepage for a field trip I help corridinate at my school. 
I want to update the links in the up right to hold .pdfs of the permission slips and include the actual chaperone form.
